# Microservice Application

This is a microservice application built with NestJS and Node.js. It uses Kubernetes, Socket.IO, and RabbitMQ for real-time communication and event handling. The application's data is stored in MongoDB.

## Technologies Used

- NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Kubernetes: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
- RabbitMQ: An open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
- MongoDB: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
